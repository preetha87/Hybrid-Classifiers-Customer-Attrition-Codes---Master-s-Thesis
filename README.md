# Hybrid-Classifiers-Customer-Attrition-Codes---Master-s-Thesis
This repository comprises of an Ipython notebook (which was the Artefact for my Master's Thesis) that contains all the codes and output for the entire EDA process, model building and model validation processes for all hybrid classifiers, ensemble classifiers and single classifiers that were built to predict customer attrition for a large grocery retail chain. This repository also contains the data repository that was used in this empirical study, which was compiled and organized by global data science firm Dunhumby.
